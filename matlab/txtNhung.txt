Lunar New Year Festival often falls between late January and early February; it is among the most important holidays in Vietnam. Officially, the festival includes the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd day in Lunar Calendar; however, Vietnamese people often spend nearly a month celebrating this special event. Tet Holiday gets its beginning marked with the first day in the Lunar Year; however, its preparation starts long before that.
